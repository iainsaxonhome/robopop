# robopop - Arduino Powered Popcorn Coffee Roaster

This repo houses the various components used to make my arduino powered popcorn coffee roaster.

Its a mess but I want to make sure I create a back up of the work to date so its not just on my PC.

Hopefully if someone else can make sense of it they can benefit and jump into home coffee roasting.
